# 🧠 Zelda Clicky Game 🧠
An app that tests your memory!!

## 📝 Description 📝
Link to the application: 

In this app you will see 12 cards that have characters from a favorite game of mine, The Legend of Zelda. The purpose of the game is to test your memory by allowing you to click on a card. Once the card is clicked, they shuffle out of order and you will click on a different card each click. You can not choose the same card or it will be considered a loss and you will get a "Game over" pop-up and restarts the game once okay is clicked.
